          What do we know about alleged Trump signature on Epstein letter?
        </h1>
        <p class="description-text">
          A "birthday letter" to Jeffrey Epstein from 2003, allegedly signed by
          Donald Trump, has been released by US lawmakers. The White House has
          said, "the president did not write this letter, he did not sign this
          letter", but Democrats believe it is authentic. There has been a
          particular focus on the signature - BBC Verify's Jake Horton has been
          examining it, with the help of handwriting experts. Produced by Aisha
          Sembhi. Graphics by Leo Scutt-Richter.
